# aiven_flink_table (Resource)

The Flink Table resource allows the creation and management of Aiven Tables.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aiven_flink_table" "table" {
    project = data.aiven_project.pr1.project
    service_name = aiven_flink.flink.service_name
    table_name = "<TABLE_NAME>"
    integration_id = aiven_service_integration.flink_kafka.service_id

    # valid if the service integration refers to a postgres or mysql service
    jdbc_table = "<JDBC_TABLE_NAME>"

    # valid if the service integration refers to a kafka service
    kafka_topic = aiven_kafka_topic.table_topic.topic_name

    partitioned_by = "node"

    schema_sql = <<EOF
      `+"`cpu`"+` INT,
      `+"`node`"+` INT,
      `+"`occurred_at`"+` TIMESTAMP(3) METADATA FROM 'timestamp',
      WATERMARK FOR `+"`occurred_at`"+` AS `+"`occurred_at`"+` - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
    EOF
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **integration_id** (String) The id of the service integration that is used with this table. It must have the service integration type `flink`. To set up proper dependencies please refer to this variable as a reference. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **project** (String) Identifies the project this resource belongs to. To set up proper dependencies please refer to this variable as a reference. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **schema_sql** (String) The SQL statement to create the table. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **service_name** (String) Specifies the name of the service that this resource belongs to. To set up proper dependencies please refer to this variable as a reference. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **table_name** (String) Specifies the name of the table. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.

### Optional

- **connector_type** (String) When used as a source, upsert Kafka connectors update values that use an existing key and delete values that are null. For sinks, the connector correspondingly writes update or delete messages in a compacted topic. If no matching key is found, the values are added as new entries. For more information, see the Apache Flink documentation The possible values are `kafka` and `upsert_kafka`. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **jdbc_table** (String) Name of the jdbc table that is to be connected to this table. Valid if the service integration id refers to a mysql or postgres service. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **kafka_key_format** (String) Kafka Key Format The possible values are `avro`, `avro-confluent`, `debezium-avro-confluent`, `debezium-json` and `json`. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **kafka_topic** (String) Name of the kafka topic that is to be connected to this table. Valid if the service integration id refers to a kafka service. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **kafka_value_format** (String) Kafka Value Format The possible values are `avro`, `avro-confluent`, `debezium-avro-confluent`, `debezium-json` and `json`. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **like_options** (String) [LIKE](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/sql/create/#like) statement for table creation. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **partitioned_by** (String) A column from the `schema_sql` field to partition this table by. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.

### Read-Only
